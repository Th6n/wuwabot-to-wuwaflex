First thing I got an idea of trying to automate WUWAFlex stats through discord bot from the official discord Wuwa bot.

Halfway I kinda gave up a little bit since, I'm still stuck at the tutorial hell since I'm not really good at coding myself and somehow 
kinda vibe code most of the time which make me kinda ashamed so I halt this project.

If I do ever continuing this I might explain on how this feature will work by using discord bot.

If any of you guys do find this little project interesting and don't mind to help me learning to code
the right way go ahead DM me through discord "tiosen".

At this point, I'm just adding any feature that I want to automate through my own discord bot to run it on my private discord server xd.

<!-- This one is my old plan -->
maybe imma try making a discord bot to automate the process to use Wuwaflex website using one command
and uploading wuwabot /create image using image link instead since we are using wuwabot through discord.

But to do that honestly I'm kinda lost right now so maybe it might take some time.
