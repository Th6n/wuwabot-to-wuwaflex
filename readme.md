<!-- This one is my old plan -->
maybe imma try making a discord bot to automate the process to use Wuwaflex website using one command
and uploading wuwabot /create image using image link instead since we are using wuwabot through discord.

Useful source to learn using discord.py if you want to try doing it urself through this REPO: [discordpy documentation](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
